# React Fiber Architecture

## Introduction

React Fiber is an ongoing reimplementation of React's core algorithm. It is the culmination of over two years of research by the React team.

The goal of React Fiber is to increase its suitability for areas like animation, layout, and gestures. Its headline feature is **incremental rendering**: the ability to split rendering work into chunks and spread it out over multiple frames.

Other key features include the ability to pause, abort, or reuse work as new updates come in; the ability to assign priority to different types of updates; and new concurrency primitives.


### What is reconciliation?

<dl>
  <dt>reconciliation</dt>
  <dd>The algorithm React uses to diff one tree with another to determine which parts need to be changed.</dd>

  <dt>update</dt>
  <dd>A change in the data used to render a React app. Usually the result of `setState`. Eventually results in a re-render.</dd>
</dl>

### *Reconciliation is the algorithm behind what is popularly understood as the "virtual DOM."*
A high-level description goes something like this: when you render a React application, a tree of nodes that describes the app is generated and saved in memory. This tree is then flushed to the rendering environment — for example, in the case of a browser application, it's translated to a set of DOM operations. When the app is updated (usually via `setState`), a new tree is generated. The new tree is diffed with the previous tree to compute which operations are needed to update the rendered app.

### Reconciliation versus rendering

The DOM is just one of the rendering environments React can render to, the other major targets being native iOS and Android views via React Native.

The reason it can support so many targets is because React is designed so that reconciliation and rendering are separate phases. The reconciler does the work of computing which parts of a tree have changed; the renderer then uses that information to actually update the rendered app.

This separation means that React DOM and React Native can use their own renderers while sharing the same reconciler, provided by React core.

### Scheduling

<dl>
  <dt>scheduling</dt>
  <dd>the process of determining when work should be performed.</dd>

  <dt>work</dt>
  <dd>any computations that must be performed. Work is usually the result of an update (e.g. <code>setState</code>).
</dl>

React's [Design Principles](https://facebook.github.io/react/contributing/design-principles.html#scheduling) document is so good on this subject that I'll just quote it here:

> In its current implementation React walks the tree recursively and calls render functions of the whole updated tree during a single tick. However in the future it might start delaying some updates to avoid dropping frames.
>
> React is not a generic data processing library. It is a library for building user interfaces. We think that it is uniquely positioned in an app to know which computations are relevant right now and which are not.

The key points are:

- In a UI, it's not necessary for every update to be applied immediately; in fact, doing so can be wasteful, causing frames to drop and degrading the user experience.
- Different types of updates have different priorities — an animation update needs to complete more quickly than, say, an update from a data store.
- A push-based approach requires the app (you, the programmer) to decide how to schedule work. A pull-based approach allows the framework (React) to be smart and make those decisions for you.

## What is a fiber?

We're about to discuss the heart of React Fiber's architecture. Fibers are a much lower-level abstraction than application developers typically think about. 

Here we go!

We've established that a primary goal of Fiber is to enable React to take advantage of scheduling. Specifically, we need to be able to

- pause work and come back to it later.
- assign priority to different types of work.
- reuse previously completed work.
- abort work if it's no longer needed.

In order to do any of this, we first need a way to break work down into units. In one sense, that's what a fiber is. A fiber represents a **unit of work**.


### Structure of a fiber

*Note: as we get more specific about implementation details, the likelihood that something may change increases. Please file a PR if you notice any mistakes or outdated information.*

In concrete terms, a fiber is a JavaScript object that contains information about a component, its input, and its output.
