# React-Vite Project Structure

An overview of the React-Vite file structure:

```
README.md
  node_modules/
  public/
    favicon.ico
  src/
    App.js
    index.js
    components/
      Header.js
      Footer.js
    styles/
      index.css/
  index.html
  package.json
```
- **README.md:** This is a file that contains the documentation for your app.

- **node_modules /:** This is a directory that contains all the dependencies (third-party packages) required by your app. These packages are installed using npm or yarn.

- **public /:** This directory contains static assets that are served directly by your app, such as favicon.

- **src /:** This directory contains the source code for your app.

  - **App.jsx:** This is the main component of your app.

  - **main.jsx:** This is the entry point of your app, where you render the main component (App.js) and mount it to the DOM.

  - **components /:** This directory contains all the components used in your app. Each component is typically defined in its own file.

  - **styles /:** This directory contains all the CSS styles used in your app.

- **index.html:**  - The HTML file that serves as the template for your app.

- **package.json:** This is a file that contains information about your app, including its name, version, dependencies, and scripts.

# Code explaination

```
// app.jsx
function App() {
  return (
    <h1>hello world</h1>
  );
}
export default App;
```
- function App() { : Defines a functional component named App.
- return ( : Indicates the start of the component's JSX structure.
- ```<h1> hello world </h1> ```: Renders an ``<h1>`` tag with the text "hello world".
- ); : Indicates the end of the JSX structure.
- export default App; : Exports the App component as the default export from this module.

```
// main.jsx
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client';
import App from './App.jsx';

ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')).render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <App />
  </React.StrictMode>,
);

```
- import React from 'react'; : Imports the React library.
- import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client'; : Imports the ReactDOM library for rendering React components.
- import App from './App.jsx'; : Imports the App component from the App.jsx file.
- `ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')).render(` : Initiates the rendering process and specifies the root element with the id 'root' where the React app will be mounted.
- `<React.StrictMode>` : Wraps the App component with React Strict Mode, which helps catch common mistakes and potential issues during development.
- `<App />` : Renders the App component within the Strict Mode wrapper.
- `</React.StrictMode>`, : Closes the Strict Mode wrapper.
